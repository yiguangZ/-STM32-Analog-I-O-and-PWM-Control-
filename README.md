# -STM32-Analog-I-O-and-PWM-Control-
This project demonstrates how to use the STM32L476 microcontroller for analog input/output and PWM signal generation. It integrates ADC readings, DAC waveform output, EXTI interrupt-driven control, and LED brightness modulation using PWM, forming a responsive embedded control loop.
